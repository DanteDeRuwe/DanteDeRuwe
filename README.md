### Hi there <img src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/Hi.gif" width="29px" height="29px"> 

I'm a technical consultant and full-stack software developer. My passion is designing and building software solutions, mainly with C# and .NET. I am fascinated by software architecture, clean code, and software craftsmanship.

During his experiences, I was often described as an enthusiastic, spontaneous and social person, that values open communication and humor. My inquisitiveness and eagerness to learn often lead to fruitful discussions within the team, as I like to continuously improve.

In my free time, I like to cook, meet with friends, and also picked up the hobby of playing and collecting board games. As far as sports go, I play racket sports and am an avid skier. I also enjoy music; whether that be listening to it, going to see it live, or playing it myself.
