### Hi there <img src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/Hi.gif" width="29px"> 

Iâ€™m a full-stack software developer, looking to become the IT professional of the future. My passion is designing and building software solutions, mainly with C# and .NET. I am fascinated by software architecture, clean code, and software craftsmanship.

Enthusiastic, eager to learn, and always looking for a challenge. In my free time, I like to cook, meet with friends, and recently picked up the hobby of playing and collecting board games. I also enjoy music; whether that be listening to it, going to see it live, or playing it myself.
