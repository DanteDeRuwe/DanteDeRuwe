### Hi there <img src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/Hi.gif" width="29px"> 

My name is Dante. I'm a student Applied Information Technology at Ghent University College, looking to become the IT professional of the future. 
Enthusiastic, eager to learn, and always looking for a challenge!

I would also consider myself a full-stack developer, science enthusiast and interneteer. I like to cook, sing, play the guitar, and laugh at my own jokes.
